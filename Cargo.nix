  # Noteworthy:
  # * `crateBin = [{name = ","; path = ",";}];`: a hack to disable building the binary.
  # * `dependencies`/`buildDependencies`: similar to the corresponding fields for buildRustCrate.
  #   but with additional information which is used during dependency/feature resolution.
  # * `resolvedDependencies`: the selected default features reported by cargo - only included for debugging.
